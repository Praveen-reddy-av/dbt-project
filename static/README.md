#Transforming data in S3 with Redshift & dbt

In this workshop, you will learn how dbt, an open source transformation tool, empowers analysts to transform, test, and document their own SQL data pipelines using dataops best practices. Experience a hands-on introduction from development to deployment. Participants will be guided through transforming raw data from an S3 bucket using Redshift Spectrum orchestrating the production pipeline. Along the way, we will give an overview of dbt, git, and a CI/CD workflow for analytics.
